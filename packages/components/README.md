### Installation

npm install @cassette/components @cassette/core
```

#### Components included:
* `MaybeMarquee` - used to make content scroll in marquee fashion, only when the container area is too small for all the content to be displayed at once

* `ProgressBarDisplay` - a non-interactive version of `ProgressBar`
* `VideoDisplay` - a display canvas for the video content from the surrounding `playerContext`
